Basic workflow:

1. install git
1. clone dev branch to your computer: git clone https://github.com/vchub/bid_op.git
1. add, change files
1. pull current state of the branch from repository (git pull origin dev)
1. resolve conflicts if branch wasn't auto-merged
1. pull current state from repository again to check conflicts (git pull origin dev)
1. push changes to the repository: git push origin master
1. continue adding and changing files



### Eclipse 3.7
Eclipse 3.7: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/indigo/sr2

### Scala IDE for Eclipse

http://scala-ide.org/download/current.html

update site link: http://download.scala-ide.org/releases-29/stable/site

Requirements

* JDK 5 or JDK 6 (JDK 7 can be used with some caveats).
* Eclipse, including the JDT. “Eclipse Classic” is sufficient, but any Eclipse package can be used.
* Both Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) and Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) are supported.

I tried it wiht Eclipse 4 (Juno). It wasn't a very good experience. On the other hand it may be fixed already.

### Play framework
* Play framework is the application framework used in the project
* download play framework from http://download.playframework.org/releases/play-2.0.3.zip
* uzip to the work dir
* add play dir to PATH variable. Like PATH;c:\vlad\bin\play-2.0.3

### Prepare the Eclipse project
* clone project from repo like:

      $> c:\vlad\code> git clone https://github.com/vchub/bid_op.git

* cd to the new dir

      $> cd bid_op

* run play framework

      $> play

* compile project

      [bid]# compile

* run command eclipsify. it prepares eclipse project

      [bid]# eclipsify

* open eclipse and import the project.

It looks ugly though. many jars stay on root level. I don't know how change it right now

### Project
After cloning the repository, you can import the Project to Eclipse. (File->Import->General->Project)

Analytical module source dir - app/models/optimizer/


### Project structure
* Most of the source code is in bid_op/app
* Analytical module in bid_op/app/models/optimizer
* The project is built by sbt (simple built tool). To run the project and complete stack of Tests "play" command can be used, like

      $> cd bid_op

      $> play

      [bid]# ~compile   //to compile on every change in source files

      [bid]# test       // to run tests


### Tests
* Tests are in bid_op/test/models/optimizer
* From Eclipse only JUnit tests can run now. For scala tests sbt has to be used

There are a couple JUnit test examples. I gonna add more soon.
